===================================================
FRAMEWORK
---------------------------------------------------
- Question or problem definition
- Data Acquition (training & testing)
- Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data
- Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data
- Model, predict and solve the problem
- Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution
- Supply or submit the results
===================================================
The workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.

- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.
- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.
- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.
- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.
